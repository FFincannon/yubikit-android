# Quick Start Guide

--

This guide provides a few steps to follow before starting with YubiKit:

1. YubiKit requires a physical key to test its features.

2. Before starting to look at the SDK make sure you have the zip file containing all the necessary assets for using the library. The most important ones are:
	- The **YubiKitDemo** folder containing the SDK Demo application.
	- The **Readme.md** which contains detailed information on how to use the library.

3. Have a quick look at the **Readme.md** file to familiarise with the features of the YubiKit.

4. Open the YubiKitDemo Android Studio project and run it on a real device (not emulator). FIDO2 API are not supported on emulator so a real device is required to see the features.
